# Semantic-html
Homework assignment 1 
An example of semantic HTML
I changed the title to Horiseon so it can appear on the tab.

added .benifit cost to the .benifit brand i put them together and deleted .benifit cost

added Horiseon to main header cause is said "hori"
then deleted the class element with seon cause it was unnecessary.
deleted to rest of what was in the h1 and only left the header.

Some text in the header h1 was shaded different and so i fixed that also.

modified stlye sheet and addeded .benefit-brand img & .benefit-cost img to .benefit-lead to  make the code look cleaner instead of having all these seperated and taking up space" 
[main 7dab23d] modified stlye sheet and addeded .benefit-brand img & .benefit-cost img to .benefit-lead to  make the code look cleaner instead of having all these seperated and taking up space.

I deleted div in the header and just put it as header cause div in the header was not relevent.

After I had to deleted the .class element on all the headers in css style shhet because I deleted the div earlier and it was unnecessary to keep the . class elenemt.

Changed the div in line 13 & 25 to nav type.

Changed lines 27,28,29 to section instead of div and then changed what they were correlated to to section also cause div is not semantic.

Changed lines with div and added section & also instead of div on line 51 & 72 I added aside"

Added notes to my read.me to document my progress & also added footer to line 74 & 79
