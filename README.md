Homework assignment 1 
An example of semantic HTML
I changed the title to Horiseon so it can appear on the tab.
added .benifit cost to the .benifit brand i put them together and deleted .benifit cost"
[main 8f81d80] added .benifit cost to the .benifit brand i put them together and deleted .benifit cost
added Horiseon to main header cause is said "hori"
then deleted the class element with seon cause it was unnecessary.
deleted to rest of what was in the h1 and only left the header
